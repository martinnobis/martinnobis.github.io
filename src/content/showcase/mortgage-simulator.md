[Mortgage Simulator](https://www.mortgage-simulator.com) simulates a typical Australian mortgage by calculating the interest accrued everyday and taking into account when it gets charged and when repayments are made. It needs to do a bunch of math for each day so for a 30 year mortgage it does a lot of calculations!

Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/martinnobis/mortgage-simulator). I used [React](https://react.dev) to create it and it's also hosted on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).
