[Bicycle Nutrition](https://www.bicyclenutrition.com) is a tool for creating your own on-the-bike sugar drink, useful for preventing bonks. I converted it from an Excel spreadsheet I used for a while to a website so that I can share it with others.

Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/martinnobis/bicycle-nutrition). It's a very simple website made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and it's hosted on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).
